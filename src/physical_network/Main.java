 * 
 * This is a test which joins two network cards together with a wire pair.
 * It then sends a data frame across the network from Network Card A to
 * Network Card B which has a simple listener which prints out the it
 * has received the data frame.
 * 
 * An oscilloscope is also connected to the wire to allow the voltage levels
 * to be monitored over time.
 * 
 * A source for thermal noise can also be connected to the wire which simulates
 * noise on the network to see how robust the transmission process is to noise.
